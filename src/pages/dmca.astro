      To submit a DMCA takedown notice, please send an email to <a
        href="mailto:legal@preservetube.com">legal@preservetube.com</a
      > that includes the following information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been
          infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single
          notification, provide a representative list of such works.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material that you claim is infringing and
          information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material,
          including the URL(s) where the infringing material is located on
          PreserveTube.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your contact information, including your full legal name, mailing
          address, telephone number, and email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the
          copyrighted materials described above and contained on the service is
          not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you hereby declare, under penalty of perjury, that
          the information in your notification is accurate and that you are the
          owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest, or
          authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other
          intellectual property interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on
          behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property
          interest.
        </li>
      </ul>

      If we receive a valid DMCA takedown notice, we will add a notice to the
      video page indicating that the content has been stricken with a copyright
      claim. This notice will include the name of the person or entity that sent
      the copyright notice and the email logs associated with the notice. If the
      video is obviously copyrighted content, such as a movie or TV show, it
      will be taken down. Any other videos will remain online.<br /><br />
      Please note that submitting a false or misleading DMCA takedown notice may
      result in legal consequences. If you are unsure whether your copyrighted material
      has been infringed or if you need legal advice, we recommend that you consult
      with an attorney.<br /><br />
      P.S.: A DMCA takedown notice will not remove embarrassing videos that Preservetube
      has archived from the internet. We will ensure that the videos remain accessible
      to the public, even if that's not possible via our website.<br /><br />

      If you have any questions about this DMCA policy, please contact <a
